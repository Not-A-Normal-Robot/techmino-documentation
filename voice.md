# Voice
This documentation is for creating a voice pack for Techmino.

Original: https://github.com/26F-Studio/Techmino/blob/498a0ef7e82f0f37fe60aa861454ea3ae129b2b0/document/mode.txt , updated 2021-07-19

## General instructions
Below are voice clip files that Techmino is using or might use in the future.

You can record as many clips as you want for the same line. If there are multiple clips for a line, a clip will be played at random, so voice lines that combine with other lines will have less freedom, otherwise the combinations will sound weird.

The filenames follow the following format: say for the voice line `mini`, the file names will be `mini_1.ogg`, `mini_2.ogg`, etc.

If there is only one clip for a line, you can omit the `_1`, but you cannot skip numbers if there are multiple clips.

If you are contributing raw, unprocessed audio, please use wav file format.

If you want to import your voice pack into the game yourself, you need to process the audio (reduce noise, crop, adjust volume) and convert to ogg format. (we don't support other formats, cuz ogg is small)

## Voice lines that are currently in-use

### `single`, `double`, `triple`, `techrash`
You can read them literally. They are for the line clears.

(Techrash is pronounced /'tekræʃ/. If you are recording in Japanese, here's the katakana: テクラッシュ.)

### `mini`, `b2b`, `b2b2b`
These will be combined with the spin or Techrash line clears.

(read "b2b" as "Back to Back", "b2b2b" as "Back to Back to Back")

### `[piece]-spin`
Each of these will combine into various voice lines, for example, Z-Spin, Z-Spin Single, Z-Spin Double, Z-Spin Triple, Z-Spin Techrash.

You need the spin clips for Z, S, J, L, T, O, I.

You can also have clips for those pentominoes: PQFEUVWXRYNH, but they are hardly used (only in pentomino mode) and bloat the size of the voice clips, feel free to omit them.

### `perfect_clear`, `half_clear`
You can read them literally or make some adjustments.

("Perfect clear" is also known as "All clear", but Techmino uses the former. "Half clear" doesn't have a consistent English name yet)

### `win`, `lose`, `bye`
Go wild, as long as they fit the situation.

### `test`, `happy`, `doubt`, `sad`, `egg`
`test` is for testing voice volume in settings. Keep it short.

The rest are easter eggs. They hardly trigger at all, feel free to leave them out.

### `welcome_voc`
A welcome when you open the game, like Osu! has.

## Upcoming voice lines

### `split`

## Potential future voice lines
None (for now)
