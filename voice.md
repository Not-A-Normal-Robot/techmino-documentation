# Voice
This documentation is for creating a voice pack for Techmino.

Original: https://github.com/26F-Studio/Techmino/blob/d3f8c33fb33ee192addb90ad33f28e13ff4ca674/document/voice.txt , updated 2021-09-19

## General instructions
***__You can record as many clips as you want for one voice line. The game will play one at random, which makes it sound more natural.__***

also considering the randomness of having multiple clips, you shouldn't go too wild with the clips that combine with other ones, or the combination can sound weird.

If you have multiple files, name them like `mini_1.ogg`, `mini_2.ogg`...

If you only have one file for one line, you can omit the `_1`, i.e. `mini.ogg`. If you have multiple files, the number must not skip, and must start from 1.

If you are contributing voice packs, please submit wav files. The submission will be kept in case future need of different format conversion.

If you want to import your voice pack into the game yourself, you need to process the audio (reduce noise, crop, adjust volume) and convert to ogg format. (we don't support other formats, cuz ogg is small)

## Voice lines that are currently in-use
Unless otherwise stated, the file name prefix is the same as the bolded word

* **single**
* **double**
* **triple**
* **techrash** (read /'tekrʌʃ/. If you are recording in Japanese, here's the katakana: テクラッシュ.)
* **pentacrash** (read /'pæntəkrʌʃ/)
* **hexacrash** (read /'heksəkrʌʃ/)
  * for line clears.
* **mini**
* **back to back** (filename: `b2b`. It's a bit long, you might want to read it faster.)
* **back to back to back** (filename: `b2b2b`. It's a bit long(er), you might want to read it faster.)
  * They will be added before line clears. End this clip like your sentence didn't finish (MrZ says "raising tone", which I don't exactly think agree. I guess you could, for example, read "mini T-spin", and edit out the "T-spin".)
* **Z-spin** (filename: `zspin0`. It's for when you spin but didn't clear a line. End this clip with a falling tone as if your sentence ended. Note that the filename prefix comes with a zero - you should still add the `_1`, `_2` etc if necessary.)
* **Z-spin** (filename: `zspin`. It's for when you did a spin line clear. End this clip like your sentence didn't finish.)
  * The two above: we need these for all pieces (filename: just replace the first letter). The pieces include:<br />
    Z, S, L, J, T, O, I (Tetriminoes)<br />
    P, Q, F, R, U, V, W, X, R, Y, N, H (pentominoes)<br />
    C (trimino)
* **all clear** (filename: `all_clear`. MrZ recommends that you record a few "perfect clear" clips too)
* **clear** (MrZ recommends that you record a few "half clear" clips too)
* voice clip on win (filename: `win`)
* voice clip on lose (filename: `lose`)
* voice clip on game launch (filename: `welcome`)
* voice clip on quitting game (filename: `bye`. Rant from User670: I don't think I'll trigger this one EVER: I'll just use the X on PC or the home button on mobile to quit the game...)
  * These four clips: don't make them too long, MAX two seconds. MrZ recommends that you record a few different versions.
* voice clip when dragging the volume slider (filename: `test`. Make it VERY short! Examples given by MrZ: "Ah", "Meow", "Um". I reckon you can also literally say "test", idk)
* easter egg voice clip 1 (filename: `happy`, MrZ recommends a short laugh)
* easter egg voice clip 2 (filename: `doubt`, MrZ recommends a "Hm?")

The following clips are not used in-game, but might come in handy in the future. If you can, get a few of those as well. They will be used in combination with other clips, so end like your sentence didn't finish, like you did with "mini".
* **spilt**
* **air** (mid-air line clears)
* **mix** (... "mixed" line clear? no idea what that might mean)
* **color**
* **deep** (deep-drop line clears)
